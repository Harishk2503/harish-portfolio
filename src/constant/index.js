        detail: 'This project involved creating a front-end replica of OpenAI\'s ChatGPT application. Utilising React for dynamic UI components, JavaScript and TypeScript for interactivity, and CSS for aesthetics, I was able to closely mirror the real-time interactions of ChatGPT. React\'s role in developing interactive UI components was crucial, enhancing the overall user experience. JavaScript and TypeScript facilitated user input handling and conversation thread management, showcasing the interactivity of the site. The use of CSS allowed for meticulous design, closely mimicking ChatGPT\'s visual appeal. Even though the replica doesn\'t interact with an AI backend, the frontend is designed for potential future integration. In summary, this project demonstrated my proficiency in React, JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS, underscoring my front-end development capabilities and my commitment to creating visually engaging and interactive applications.',
